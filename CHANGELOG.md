# 0.3.0 (2025-10-26)
### New Features
- Added **compile-time type checking** for binding task outputs to inputs.
- **Added** `[1 ‚Üí N]` task mapping and propagation: use `map_tuple_with()` to map a single output to multiple results, which are then passed to downstream tasks via `bind_all_to()`.
- Added new `try_submit()` method: returns an error if the task ID already exists (as opposed to `submit()`, which updates existing tasks).
- **Formalized `CondAddr`**: Refactored the previously implicit concept of a condition's location into an explicit, first-class concept (`CondAddr`) with dedicated type support.
### Breaking Changes
- `to()` changed to `bind_to()`


# 0.2.1 (2025-07-17)
- Add ANSI color support for log messages
- `CallParam::typename()` added to show concrete, human-readable type information when the types of condition and data are not identical.


# 0.2.0 (2025-07-16)
### üÜï New Features
- Added logging support with detailed debug information to assist troubleshooting
### ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes
- Deprecated `task()` in favor of `into_task()` to follow Rust's ownership conventions


# 0.1.1 (2025-7-10)
- `Courier<F,C,R>`: The generic parameter `C` refers to the element type inside it, and is no longer wrapped in `Option`. Changing from `Courier<F, (Option<P>,..), R>`  to `Courier<F, (P,..), R>`.
- Examples: Improved clarity and readability


# 0.1.0 (2025-7-9)
- Initial implementation of core functionality.
- Implemented basic concepts of task, queue, thread and pool.
